n computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.[1] A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.

Firewalls are categorized as a network-based or a host-based system. Network-based firewalls are positioned between two or more networks, typically between the LAN and WAN.[8] They are either a software appliance running on general-purpose hardware, a hardware appliance running on special-purpose hardware, or a virtual appliance running on a virtual host controlled by a hypervisor. Firewall appliances may also offer non firewall functionality, such as DHCP[9][10] or VPN[11] services. Host-based firewalls are deployed directly on the host itself to control network traffic or other computing resources.[12][13] This can be a daemon or service as a part of the operating system or an agent application for protection.
